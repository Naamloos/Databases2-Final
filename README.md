# Database Profiler
This is my Databases 2 End Assignment.

## Setup
For this to work, an SQL Server instance and a MongoDB instance have to be set up on the local machine.

This also requires the database I have made for the weekly assignments to be loaded into the server under database `Netflix`, and a new MongoDB Database to be loaded under `NhlStenden.Netflix`.

### Additional comments
- The connection strings can be modified in `Constants.cs`.
- The created databases are `Netflix` and `NetflixCodeFirst` in SQL Server and `Netflix` in MongoDB.
